                    <p>I am aspiring to learn and create a career for myself in computer science. computer science is a filed that I've had interest in since I was a child. Understanding the inner workings of the technology that we use on a daily basis feels integral to knowing why and how technology plays a part in our society as much as it does.</p>
                    <p>My superpower is being able to adapt to new situations quickly. The ability to quickly assess a situation and adjust yourself accordingly has always been a skill that I thought to be needed no matter what an individual does in society. Quick thinking with an imaginative and logical mind can create the simple soution to a complicated problem.</p>
